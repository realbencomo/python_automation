Scripts for IT automation using Python

- Here you will find some projects I've done to master IT automation processes using the easily readable and widely available Python programming language.
- All the scripts will have the following mentality in mind:
  1: Easy to understand.
  2: Scalable.
  3: Practical for actual use in either local run or cloud run environments.
- Knowledge is a human affair so feel free to use this code as I've built it while using the knowledge of others.
